# Musixmatch API Lyrics Generator using Python

This is my first project which is still a work in progress. I hope to add more to this project as I gain more knowledge and my skills improve. Using Musixmatch open source API, constant Googling, and countless video tutorials helped me make this.

It's pretty simple, there are only 3 options: 

1. Call API method(s) & view JSON data. This will return a list of API methods for the user to choose from. After selecting the required method(s), this will return the final API call (all calls the user made) along with the lyrics

2. Find lyrics via artist & song name. This is the simplest way, all the user needs to do is type in the artist and song name and this will return the lyrics. Note: I'm using the free version of Musixmatch API so it will only show 30% of the lyrics

3. Quit. Quits the program
